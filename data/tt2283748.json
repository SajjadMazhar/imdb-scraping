    "bio": "Oh my God is a story about a person (Kanji Lalji Mehta) who loses his shop in an earthquake. The shop is located an area in Mumbai, known as chor bazaar. Kanji is a person, who even does not fear God and even puts God on ill usage, for his benefit. After disaster, Kanji lodges complaint against God as he does not get benefit of insurance due to act of God. The notice is sent to all bigger baba's. He first goes through a lot of resistance, but eventually people turn out in his favor. People from other religions also join him. Thus notice is sent to every religious head. Later its shown how Kanji wins and people who have lodged complaint against disaster caused get benefited. Its also shown how dongis are bought into vision of normal people. \u2014muvi-fan-73",
