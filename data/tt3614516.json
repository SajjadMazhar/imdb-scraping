    "bio": "Raje Bauji (Sanjay Mishra) is a man in his late fifties, living out a dreary but eventful life in a small house in old Delhi- where he lives with his extended family. A random incident is going to change his life in a dramatic way- though he does not realize at the moment. Bauji's daughter has been seeing a boy of ill repute. When that fact is revealed to the family, after much deliberation they decide to do the obvious- lock up the girl and go beat the willful boy. It is a funny old journey of this man, this old fool- who is both Lear and the fool. \u2014Wikipedia",
