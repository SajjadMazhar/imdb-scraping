    "bio": "Georgekutty (Mohanlal) is a cable-TV network owner in a remote hilly village in Kerala. He lives a happy life with his wife and two daughters. The first half revolves around the depiction of their happy family. Anju (Ansiba), Georgekutty's daughter, goes on a school trip between the proceedings. After a few days, a guy who had been at the school trip with her meets Anju. He blackmails her with a video of her that he had captured during the school trip. In the course of events he is accidentally killed by Rani (Meena) and Anju. Georgekutty on returning home is appraised of the events and thus begins a cat and mouse game as the murdered person is the son of IG Geeta Prabhakar (Asha Sharath) and Prabhakar (Siddique). How the family weathers the storm that ensues during the murder investigation forms the rest of the story leading to a deeply satisfying and unexpected climax. \u2014Athul",
