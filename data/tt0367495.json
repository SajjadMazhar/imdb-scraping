Madhavan), an arrogant young advertisement filmmaker who favors capitalism meet. They get stuck with each other on their problem-filled trip from Bhubaneswar to Chennai, giving them a unique opportunity to explore each other's belief system. Themes such as globalization, financial disparity and compassion in present-day India are explored around the two protagonists, while they also find how deeply interconnected their lives are. \u2014Santhosh",
