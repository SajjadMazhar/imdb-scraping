In this film, a police officer whose family was filled by a bandit named Gabbar Singh decides to fight fire with fire and requires two convicts, Jai and Veeru, to capture Gabbar. He approaches them in jail and puts the proposal in front of them, and they agree to bring in Gabbar Singh alive--for a hefty price. After their discharge from jail, they travel by train to the village where the police officer lives with his widowed daughter-in-law. The three band together to fight one of the most elusive and dreaded bandits of all time. Will the two ex-cons be able to bring Gabbar alive to the police officer? \u2014Calista",
